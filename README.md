# Recipe Radar

## Configuration and API Keys

### Handling Sensitive Information
This project uses a `config.dart` file to manage sensitive information like API keys. To ensure security and prevent accidental exposure of sensitive data:

1. **Add `config.dart` to `.gitignore`:** 
   Ensure that `config.dart` is included in the `.gitignore` file. This prevents Git from tracking changes to this file and avoids committing sensitive information to the repository.

    ```
    # .gitignore

    # Exclude config.dart to prevent it from being tracked
    /utils/config.dart
    ```

2. **Create `config_sample.dart`:**
   Provide a `config_sample.dart` file (or similarly named) that contains placeholders or instructions for setting up the necessary configurations. This file should be committed to the repository and serves as a template for developers to create their own `config.dart` file.

   ```dart
   /* config_sample.dart */

   class Config {
     static const String apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';
   }
